This one was really tough. I finally tried just going maximalist and replacing
every match found at once, instead of one by one using the Golang stdlib regexp
library. The fact that it worked was, I think, a coincidence, or at least was
not guaranteed. The solution for part 2 does not work on the test data from
part 1. In any case, this does generate the right answer for the actual input
data.
